This is a repository devoted to toying with SDL and its capacity for rendering interactive 2D images. 
Additionally, it will serve as an exercise in setting up command line compilation environments on Mac and
making this compilation synergize with Windows via conditional Makefiles and #includes. It will be using c++. 
The end goal is to have a basic, clean, functional baseline on which one can build.
