This is a repository devoted to toying with command line compilation environments on Mac and
making this compilation synergize with Windows via conditional Makefiles and #includes. As a platform for this experimentation, a skeleton for SDL rendering will be made. It will be done using C++. The end goal is to have a basic, clean, functional baseline on which one can build.
